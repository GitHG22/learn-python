Hello. This is a gfile . I don't know why I am doing this. I mean, I am learning vim because I *need* to know a terminal text editor other than nano, but still. This is stupid. hjkl? Seriously?
Okay so I am learning using this built-in tutor program `vimtutor` and so far, this is amazing! I mean, I am till lesson 3 and it's just amaaazing how coehrent the commands are. The existence of a command as `rx` or `c[number]<motion>`, to be frank, blows my mind. I am getting used to hjkl too. That graph about vim learning curve might just as well be sooooooo correct.

Take that, emacs fanbois.
